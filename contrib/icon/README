mlterm icon collection
======================


- mlterm-icon-fvwm.png

    I made this icon from scratch for FVWM window manager. GPL applies it.

    These icons, designed for GNOME / GNOME 2.0, are based on GPLed icons.

- mlterm-icon-wmaker.png

    This icon is based on linuxterm.tiff in the Window Maker source
    distribution. The WindowMaker/Icons/README file said...

    "The icons listed in the end of this file and their correspondent xpm
    versions were made by Marco van Hylckama Vlieg. They may be distributed
    freely and/or modified as long as the original Author is mentioned!
    marco@windowmaker.org"


- mlterm-icon-kde.png

    This is designed for KDE and based on GPLed icons. (hi48-app-konsole.png,
    hi32-app-konqueror.png)


- mlterm-icon-twm.png

    This icon has been changed to monochromatic color for twm window manager
    from an icon which was made by Tomohiro KUBOTA san. (mlterm_48x48.xpm)
