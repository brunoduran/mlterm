 <h1>mlterm configurator on curses</h1>

 <h2>What is mlterm configurator on curses?</h2>

 <p>A tiny tool to change terminal settings of mltermi.</p>
 <p> If you have installed gtk, mlconfig can be used and this tool is not needed at all.<br>
 (mlconfig is a GUI configurator and should be more user-friendly)</p>

 <p>Or you can also try "w3mmlconfig" if you have w3m.</p>
 <p>If you are not using both of them, this tool may help you to change</p>
 <ul>
  <li>Terminal encoding</li>
  <li>X Input Method</li>
  <li>Font size/color</li>
  <li>Anti Aliasing</li>
  <li>Wall picture</li>
  <li>Transparent background</li>
  <li>... and more .</li>
 </ul>

 <p># Actually, you can send an escape sequence to your mlterm by hand and control
 its setting. For example, </p>
 <pre>
 echo -e "\e]5379;wall_picture=/path/to/file.jpg\x07"
 </pre>
<p>
 will change wall picture to /path/to/file.jpg.

 This tool was written to automagically generate such a magic
 word instead of you. 
 </p>

 <h2>Requirement</h2>
 <ul>
  <li> perl 5 (5.6 is recommended)</li>
  <li> ncurses 5.2 or compatible (BSD curses ver4.2 is known to be problematic)</li>
 </ul>

 <h2>Install</h2>
 <p> It's a plain perl script. You do not have to do anything to run.</p>
 <p>You can try by</p>
 <pre>perl mlconf_curses.pl</pre>
 <p>To install,</p>
 <p>(If your perl is not in /usr/bin, edit "PERL=" line in Makefile.) </p>
 <pre>make&amp;make install</pre>
 <p> After installation, you should be able to run this tool by </p>
 <pre>mlconf_curses</pre>
 <p>(.pl is omitted because it's ugly and someday this tool would be
 rewritten using one of other languages.)</p>
 <h2>To Do</h2>
 <ul>
  <li>Implement file selector (someday)</li>
  <li>Handle errors (REQUIRED)</li>
  <li>Write documents (who reads?)</li>
  <li>NLS (impossible?)</li>
  <li>Get rid of curses (I *know* TERM is mlterm...)</li>
  <li>Support non-standard colors (pink, lightgray etc.)</li>
  <li>Serialization (write back changes to config file)</li>
 </ul>
