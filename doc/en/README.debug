How to debug mlterm?

If you find something strange and try to send me a report, following options
will be helpful for me (and maybe for you, too).

* --enable-debug (configure option)
  mlterm outputs general debug messages.

* __DEBUG and ESCSEQ_DEBUG in ml_vt100_parser.c
  mlterm outputs huge messages which indicate how mlterm processes each escape
  sequence.
