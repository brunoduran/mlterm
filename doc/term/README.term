This directory contains data for terminfo/termcap.

* mlterm.ti : for terminfo
* mlterm.tc : for termcap 
	(converted from mlterm.ti using infotocap and
	 dropped some useless entries)

*NOTE*
"mlterm.tc" still does not fit 1K limit of termcap and
should be considered to be broken.
You may have to remove some descriptions from the file 
to make termcap work on your system.
