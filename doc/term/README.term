mlterm.ti is an exprinemtal terminfo data for mlterm.
To install, see tic(1).

*NOTE*
The corresponding data for termcap named "mlterm.tc" had been 
also placed this directory.
The file was removed because 
- making a entry for mlterm which does not over 
  termcap's entry size limit is a painful job. 
- nobody seemes to be using the data anyway.
