* What is this ?
  tlex is a very simple Terminal multipLEXer based on client-server model.
  It doesn't do anything except the management of data flow betweens ptys.
  tlex can be detached from terminal emulators and then reattached after
 running in the background like tmux or screen.

* Installation
  $ make
  $ cp tlex [the directory where you want to install]

* Usage
  $ tlex [command]
  $ [terminal emulator command] -e tlex [command]

  e.g.) mlterm -e tlex

* How does tlex work ?

            window1 === pty1 === tlex(client)         pty3 === App1
           /                        \                /
	  /                          *==============*
  Terminal                             tlex(server)
          \                          *==============*
           \                        /                \
	    window2 === pty2 === tlex(client)         pty4 === App3

  o tlex server is automatically started by tlex client.
  o Each application is bound to a specific terminal window (never changed to
    another window) until being detached.
  o If tlex server has a detached pty in being connected by tlex client, tlex
    server re-attaches it and outputs its logs stored in ~/.tlex/log-[ttyname]
    in order to reproduce its screen.
